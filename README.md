In this lab we have worked with mp4 containers. 

### Exercise 1
---
In this exercise, we have cut the BBB video, created a video strem, a mono audio stream, a low bit rate aduio stream and a subtitles stream. Then, we have packaged everything in a .mp4. To do so, we have created different funtions: to cut the original video, to create the different video and audio tracks, to add subtitles to the mp4 andanother one to pack it all. When calling the different functions, some outputs have been created (video and ausio files) that can be fount in ex1 folder. In the same folder, you can find a screenshot of the terminal after the operation 'ffmpeg -i final_container.mp4' where the different streams are shown. 

### Exercise 2
---
In this exercise, we have automatized the creation of the container so the user can choose between some options:
- Option 1: create a container with only a video stream. This option is equivalent as getting a video and only conserving the video stream.
- Option 2: cretae a container with a video and a mono autout streams. 
- Option 3: create a container with a video, a mono audio and a subtitles streams.
In all options, the user is able to choose the original file from which the streams will be selected, the name of the output streams seperately and the name of the final output container. In the ex2 folder you can find the python script and screenshots showing the terminal outputs for each option.
