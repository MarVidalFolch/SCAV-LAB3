# SCAV-LAB3

## Mar Vidal-Folch Angerri - NIA: 204751

In this lab we have worked with mp4 containers. 

### Exercise 1
---
In this exercise, we have cut the BBB video, created a video strem, a mono audio stream, a low bit rate aduio stream and a subtitles stream. Then, we have packaged everything in a .mp4. To do so, we have created different funtions: to cut the original video, to create the different video and audio tracks, to add subtitles to the mp4 andanother one to pack it all. When calling the different functions, some outputs have been created (video and ausio files) that can be fount in ex1 folder. In the same folder, you can find a screenshot of the terminal after the operation 'ffmpeg -i final_container.mp4' where the different streams are shown.
